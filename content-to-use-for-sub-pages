 My favorite projects so far have been the ice cream cows and the D&D characters.
  I asked all of my family members for their favorite ice cream flavors and was able to create a different cow for each of them.
   The flavors that I have experimented with so far are organ black cherry, cookie dough, cookies and cream, mint chocolate chip, sprinkles, and a huckleberry.
    Just for fun I found a few patterns of animals dressed up as D&D classes that I can make for fun. So far, I have finished both the dragon knight and the wizard crow. 
    I am currently working on a raccoon rouge and have many more planed for the future. 
    
    
    
    I have been acting and been in the theater program for eight years. 
    It started in sixth grade when I joined the tech team for the school play. 
    The next year I joined a Shakespear team and was able to learn how to preform different Shakespear plays as I travelled for competition. 
    I also did several plays and musicals in middle school which include Silver Secrets, Knights of The Rad Table, and Marry Poppins Jr. 
    Then I entered high school, and new opportunities were presented for me. 
    Iin my freshman year I took the acting I class that was offered and I learned about the fundamentals of acting. 
    I also performed in the pit for both Annastasia my freshman year, and Hunchback of Norte Dame my sophomore year. 
    After that I joined Troyplayers which was my schools advance acting group. 
    Both junior and senior year I competed in drama districts and drama state in the original humors category. 
    I also was a part of many more plays and musicals those years as I was in, Puffs, Anything Goes, Antigone, Mamma Mia, Decision Height, and Farnsworth Paradox. 
    Each of these different plays I have done I have learned something about myself.
