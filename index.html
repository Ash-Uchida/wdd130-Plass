            <h1>Welcome to Crazy Creator | Plass</h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is Adelaide Plass, and I am so excited to share all of the fun things that I love to do with all of you! I enjoy crochet, acting, and playing music. 

I have been crocheting since I was around eight years old when my grandma first taught me. I started of making very simple hot pads and Christmas ordainments for family members but now ten years later I have begun making large stuffed animals that I can sell. These projects have become more and more challenging as I find projects with more parts. With all of the little parts that I have to make it now takes so much longer for me to finish my projects. My favorite projects so far have been the ice cream cows and the D&D characters. I asked all of my family members for their favorite ice cream flavors and was able to create a different cow for each of them. The flavors that I have experimented with so far are organ black cherry, cookie dough, cookies and cream, mint chocolate chip, sprinkles, and a huckleberry. Just for fun I found a few patterns of animals dressed up as D&D classes that I can make for fun. So far, I have finished both the dragon knight and the wizard crow. I am currently working on a raccoon rouge and have many more planed for the future. 

I have been acting and been in the theater program for eight years. It started in sixth grade when I joined the tech team for the school play. The next year I joined a Shakespear team and was able to learn how to preform different Shakespear plays as I travelled for competition. I also did several plays and musicals in middle school which include Silver Secrets, Knights of The Rad Table, and Marry Poppins Jr. Then I entered high school, and new opportunities were presented for me. Iin my freshman year I took the acting I class that was offered and I learned about the fundamentals of acting. I also performed in the pit for both Annastasia my freshman year, and Hunchback of Norte Dame my sophomore year. After that I joined Troyplayers which was my schools advance acting group. Both junior and senior year I competed in drama districts and drama state in the original humors category. I also was a part of many more plays and musicals those years as I was in, Puffs, Anything Goes, Antigone, Mamma Mia, Decision Height, and Farnsworth Paradox. Each of these different plays I have done I have learned something about myself.</p>
