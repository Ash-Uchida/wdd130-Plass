            <p>I have been acting and been in the theater program for eight years. 
                It started in sixth grade when I joined the tech team for the school play. 
                The next year I joined a Shakespear team and was able to learn how to preform different Shakespear plays as I travelled for competition. 
                I also did several plays and musicals in middle school which include Silver Secrets, Knights of The Rad Table, and Marry Poppins Jr. </p>

            <p>Then I entered high school, and new opportunities were presented for me. 
                Iin my freshman year I took the acting I class that was offered and I learned about the fundamentals of acting. 
                I also performed in the pit for both Annastasia my freshman year, and Hunchback of Norte Dame my sophomore year. 
                After that I joined Troyplayers which was my schools advance acting group.</p>

            <p>Both junior and senior year I competed in drama districts and drama state in the original humors category. 
                I also was a part of many more plays and musicals those years as I was in, Puffs, Anything Goes, Antigone, Mamma Mia, Decision Height, and Farnsworth Paradox. 
                Each of these different plays I have done I have learned something about myself.</p>
